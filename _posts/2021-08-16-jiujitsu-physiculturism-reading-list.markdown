# Introduction

Cognitive health is directly tied to physical health, agility, mobility and balance ... much of this is because we sit too much, but a standing desk is completely insufficient. Our workflows are too rigid or sessile. We do not tend to break up our work into periods of movement and running around, punctuated by periods for focus and attention -- we just sit/stand in one place, in one posture.  As we age, the rigidity means that we adapt to sitting and more sitting -- so our bodies physically decline. Even as compensate for this decline by being much more diligent in our discipline, we sit more, sit harder, focus harder on just sitting and focusing harder on the task ... and the stress kills us.

Everyone who exercises throughout the day, quickly realizes why [in their own experience] the small amounts of time that they spend in breaking the day with physical micro-workouts, ideally in something like jiu jitsu, is actually not lost. For one thing, a person still keeps thinking about what one was working on; we don't leave work behind when we step on a mat or pick up a kettlebell -- but the movement actually increases oxygen flow to the brain at the time and cardiovascular health in general [over time] such that lesser time spent doing mental activities is actually significantly more productive, ie it is possible to actually FOCUS, rather than wish for a distraction or nap or something to eat or ...

Jijitsu is not just good for getting in better touch with one's own body, it is probably one of the best ways to work on building connections with others even if one never comes into physical contact with others, because of the shared experience of doing a very similar activity. One of the wonders of the modern interwebs is that the range of SOCIAL training that is available around the world, without the impossible penalties imposed by ridiculous commutes and impossible travel times. For a long time, the ONLY way to have any kind of connection with a martial arts master was to move to a location where one was within easy walking distance to the dojo ... frankly, for developing certain levels of competency or skill, there is NO SUBSTITUTE for this ... what is different is the accessiblity to these training materials and the instruction for basic drill FOR THE PURPOSES OF PHYSICAL HEALTH and making the time in the dojo or at seminars more effective is now available, regardless of geography.
