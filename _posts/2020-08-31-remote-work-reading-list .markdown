## Background <a name="background"></a>

This reading list is actually TWO reading lists in a way ... BOTH list are focused upon REMOTE work otherwise know as working from anywhere [rather than moving to a location and taking part in the daily commute and other aspects of on prem work].

There are TWO very different ways to go about getting remote work. The first reading list or first part of the two-part list focuses on the somewhat more traditional way of landing a job with either recruiters or job listings, albeit strictly confined to a remote work context -- but it is about waiting for companies understand a need to hire, post a position or to create the requistion for a job. The second reading list or the second part of the two part list focuses on upon inbound marketing and treating one's pool of talents as a for-hire service.  

**Why did we start curating this reading list?**
The world changed in 2020.

We noticed GIGANTIC positives that arose from covid that completely unintentional and probably completely unexpectedly ... maybe we should have seen the positives coming, but it was truly shocking, especially in terms of how much people embraced working from anywhere. The way that this happened reminded us of how incredibly negative human inertia is OR how many opportunities that humans have, but completely miss those opportunities, because they insist on have things the same old way that they always had them. This particular example reminds us, once again, why ***people who are recalcitrantly and mindlessly consistent, ie too set in their ways are a BURDEN upon their family, friends and neighbors.***

The huge jump in interest of [#RemoteJobs](https://twitter.com/search?q=%23remotejobs&src=typeahead_click&f=live) and [#RemoteWork](https://twitter.com/search?q=%23remotework&src=typed_query&f=live) was simply too large, too positive, to0 significant to ignore ... but it is a rapidly evolving landscape, ie the maps that anyone had for understanding the talent acquisition landscape in the first half of 2020 are quite simply completely irrelevant now ... the landscape is still changing and it does not particularly care what anyone's map says it is supposed to be.


## Remote Work Job Listing Sites <a name="paragraph1"></a>

This is all about the listing that companies post ... we are probably not actually going to apply for these positions, but these posted positions do give an indication of what kinds of skills were important when the positions were posted ... things change rapidly, but other than talking directly with companies who need services (ie what inbound marketing is about), there's probably not a better way to find out where the needs for talent/skills is the hottest.

## Inbound Marketing For Your Skills<a name="paragraph2"></a>
his demands that you treat your talents, skills and professional competence as a business that might offer services on a for-hire basis. Of course, when you are not actually working for a customer, you will be working for yourself, building your skills, developing connections through open source development and generally sharing your learning paths with others. This list is primarily about the best practices in inbound marketing and creating an attractive culture that draws in clients as you prospect for new leads, develop and maintain business connections, close the deals for service contracts and fulfill your orders.

[Dharmesh Shah](https://network.hubspot.com/profile/dharmesh)'s [The Hubspot Culture Code](https://network.hubspot.com/slides/the-hubspot-culture-code) explains how/why inbound marketing works. In marketing, you build two cultures or identities to inhabit. One is the dream or ideal to present to your customers [and perhaps potential employees, investors and outside stakeholders]. The other is practical culture or identity that you must live in and use, ie the one that gets the job done. The reason that they are not the same is the notion of a an especially innovative, proprietary, secret sauce known only to insiders who have signed various non-disclosure agreements. But a great OPEN culture attracts amazing OPEN people who understand why secrets are the way that organizations and people die and become fossils. Some people, some companies are frozen or calcified fossils, from a time where reputations, appearances, perceptions mattered more than open source and ability to develop solutions. Instead of being frozen as the most innovative organization or person of everything before 2021 ... and if discipline equals freedom ... why would we not aspire to continuously develop the discipline to become more free in the future, to attract the those who are continually improving their discipline to become more free. **Do the HARD work that actually REALLY matters, even if it is utilitarian or seemingly obvious and will go generally apprecited. Help billions to grow sustainably and develop over the long term. Develop and LIVE in a culture that attracts them.**
