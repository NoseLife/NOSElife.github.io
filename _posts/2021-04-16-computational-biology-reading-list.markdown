# Introduction / Background

Our interest in Biology itself, not just computational biology, is driven by our interest in being healthier and more productive and fit -- not so much for the sake of health and fitness itself, but actually for generally making every moment of life more enjoyable, more satisfying.

We are NOT particularly interested in Biology as a means of landing a job or making profitable investments -- our interest is much more immediately practical and important to our lives. The truth of something in the realm of biological is therefore likely to be somehow directly testable, ie a matter of something that we can confirm with our own experience or the experiences of those who we are / have been close to. 

In other words, our interest in Biology is not at all esoteric or about what has been proven somewhere in some magical lab -- our interest in Bioloty is about the "n of 1" Science that we will do in our own lab, our own life.

[NWChem](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NWChem) ... an ab initio computational chemistry software package which includes quantum chemical and molecular dynamics functionality. NWChem was actually designed to run on high-performance parallel supercomputers as well as conventional workstation clusters ... with an aim of being scalable both in its ability to treat large problems efficiently, and in its usage of available parallel computing resources.

[MDynaMix](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MDynaMix) ... for general purpose molecular dynamics to simulate mixtures of molecules, interacting by AMBER- and CHARMM-like force fields in periodic boundary conditions. Algorithms are included for NVE, NVT, NPT, anisotropic NPT ensembles, and Ewald summation to treat electrostatic interactions. The code was written in a mix of Fortran 77 and 90 (with Message Passing Interface (MPI) for parallel execution).
