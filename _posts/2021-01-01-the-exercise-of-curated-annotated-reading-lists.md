First, we just surf and browse ... yeah, there might be a semblance of a method to our madness googling and wikipeding, but there's not really a formal structure we leave behind ... nothing which can help someone else OR, morely likely, anything that can help US, ourselves, weeks/months/years later, when we need to re-trace our steps and repeat the googling, wikipeding to get back to where we were. 

*At some point, if we don't sink into oblivion, we DECIDE that we are going grow the fritz up and that we are going to grow up as we want to, not to please somebody else ...* 

As with formal education, we EVENTUALLY learn the importance of going a step beyond not sleeping and paying attention in class -- we eventually begin actually taking and using notes and that means re-factoring, improving and rewriting better notes to teach ourselves [and our future selves] as we study [and revisit topics later] ... AWESOME lists start to make sense for us, not just as lists of stuff to surf, but as study tools to fork and tailor to our own purposes.

*Then we grow up a bit more, maybe we stumble once or twice, the grade gets steeper in the climb, we adapt our approach to climbing and we realize that more serious climbing is about climbing with others, we must help others ...*

So we ***start*** CURATING our own forks of [AWESOME lists](https://github.com/topics/awesome) ... sorting, stripping down list, eliminating the dead links, marketing bs and other lite chaff, collecting the sample of dots that we will look at much closer ... then we go the source, READ, review cross-refernces, visit the dev community journals, discussion forums and conferences, get a sense of the people involved in order to sift out the weightier dots worthy of digging into in more depth ... then we *do things the hard way*, we IMPLEMENT, test, break, refactor, extend, re-purpose, re-process the dots ... finally, we talk about our own trip through the dots, we ANNOTATE, explain, discuss, contribute, advance ... learning is a matter of attempting to connecting ALL of the dots ... not just the jargon and factoids but also the communities and people who driving the material.

*Eventually, we start to understand why it'll never be over ... as long as humans are alive ... it can't be over ...*
## Annotation and curation is never complete, like an exercise regimen

The process of curation, like an exercise regimen, is intended to be never complete, to always be evolving, always being extended, refactored, refined ... thus, it is really about building STRONG, LIVING, MUSCULAR, FIT open source knowledge development communities through the regular exercise of knowledge development *muscles.*  There's nothing complicated about the process of curating an annotated reading list as a mental exercise -- it is an exercise that anyone can/should do, like a pushup or a burpee in the realm of physical exercise.

A list compiled last month or last year is like a pushup or burpee done lasy month, last year. Do an exercise once does mean that you advance to the Olympic podium, but there are also reasons why a man in his 90s might still find satifaction in doing a good set of pushups or burpees. Nobody cares about how many pushups you did once, decades ago, back when you were still in school, before you had gone to seed. 

It is the repititions of the exercise that you will do later today, tomorrow, next week, next month that will prevent atrophy ... and it is atrophy of our abilities rather than the acts of outsiders or aliens which we must fear most. The process of engaging in the ongoing scholarship of curation of knowledge development communities deepens, refines, sharpens, improves our knowledge and our ability to reason, think, express ourselves coherently over time.

# Building LIVING open source knowledge development communities

The reason for insisting upon fully open source materials is that we learn best from living OPEN source ***knowledge development communities*** ... it
s the community ... it's not just the end product or context-free factoid that we learn from. We learn best when we teach others and learn together; this works best when we all participate in building the resources and communities that we will rely on to advance our ability to learn.

Boundless curiosity and neverending rumination are the fundamentals necessary for knowledge development ... knowledge requires a seemingly infinite number of ruminations by a seemingly infinite community -- and there's always something more, always something that is good enough in some specific cases, but not good enough in the general case.  

Otherwise, we get the state of ANTI-knowledge known as Scientism ... worshipping scientific wonders without understand the science or its limits ...Scientism, like any dreadfully dangerous religous belief comes down to statements quoting high priests ... such as "So-and-so said such-and-such is true; so the Inquisition has ruled that the "Science is settled.'." That horrendous perversion of the scientific method is the dangerously insufficient, completely inaedequate state that even what passes for scientific knowledge is at today, eg *"Richard Feynman said it, so it must be true."*

The validity of Science depends, not upon annointed high priests, but rather upon a scientifically-literate population capable of questioning all authority ... and we do not have anything like a scientifically literate population, even we confine our investigation to the population of high school Science teachers. The tendency to worship the high priests of Scientism illustrates this clearly ... a person simply cannot be scientifically literate if they are always a member of the "Accept Authority" squad.

The scientific method requires RUMINATION and the kind of disciplined scholarship necessary for curating annoated lists of reading material ... we don't just read; we re-read ... it not just about what *IT* is, we learn from everything that explains how and why *IT* became to be regarded as what *it* is. 

EVERYTHING about knowledge development processes must be more open, more transparent ... this includes the code/algorithms/data behind the product, the issues discussions that went into bugs/feature requests, the devstats and commitgraphs, the developers making up the special interest groups working on the product ... we learn from every last piece of how the end product came to be.

If we genuinely care about knowledge, boundless curiosity is essential -- the entire process of knowledge development cannot ever be OPEN or transparent enough ... and transparency with robust curiosty is the going to be best way of obtaining the truth. The process has to be OPEN.

Curating annotated reading lists is not just about reading something, but it is really about ceasely crawling over everything about the process ... we can see the value of this in how the Classics shaped the thinking of generations after generations of people affected by the Classics, ie Shakespear's library and literary influences shape Shakespeare's writing--those plays did not spring from thin air or some sort of drug-induced haze ... but the process of ruminating on topics, finding new information, running the analysis of the data again and everything we do when we are serious about curating such OPEN lists publicly ... helps one to think about the context of what one has read, what it's impact is, whether it applies going forward. 

It's important to do this rumination or curation publicly, transparently ... with OPEN forkable lists building upon the AWESOME pattern of list repositories [as seen on Github]. It is the process of curation that goes beyond immersive reading to help people begin to learn how others learn, to learn how others express ideas, context, meaning.

## The currated annotated reading lists will not include ANY proprietary material

There might be references to things such as papers from peer-reviewed journals with a pay wall ... but that reference will be limited to a discussion of the title, abstract and authors -- the reference will not be ignored, but proprietary materials will not the *suggested* reading list ... and that's not primarily because not everyone can afford to obtain access, but because propriety restrictions restrict FULL discovery of background for knowledge development ... we need full, open, transparent access for anyone OR otherwise, the process of knowledge development is impaired.
