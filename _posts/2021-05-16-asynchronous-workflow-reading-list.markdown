# Introduction / Background

Our interest in the [asynchronous workflow pattern](https://medium.com/xebia/asynchronous-workflow-pattern-e1a59d0964f6) is not especially new ... what amazes us most is "What took so damned long?" People always should have been more insistent and vocal when asking things like *"Why couldn't this meeting have been an email?"* but people are either too conditioned or too afraid to really ask, "WTF is this confab for?" 

ASYNCH.work was pretty much always technically-possible after the invention of the telegraph, but it was not culturally possible. It was not even something that could be contemplated ... geogpraphy and boundaries were too important -- everybody wanted to build one kind of wall or another. It goes back to how we were all programmed in chalk-and-talk classrooms ... the ubiquitous programming by our educational instutions told us to have our butts in the seat, to be quiet and pay attention to the teacher and participate respectfully, appropriately with no smart comments that were above the head of the class or any kind of disruptive clowning around ... we were all supposed to be equally stupid, all thinking at the simplest of the simple, the lowest of all possible lowest common denominator classroom discussions ... 

Well that was true, at least, until 2020 came along ... and WFHing [which should have been the norm in 2000] *FINALLY* became something of a norm. Now we can recognize WHY unwanted disruptions to our norms, particularly in the realm of our workflows, are so incredibly beneficial.  If you don't understand why ASYNCH.work is a huge leap forward, well, let's just say ***there ARE more good developments that will have come out of the covid scare than we yet can understand or articulate.***

This Reading List is not going to be entirely about disrupting workflows or refactoring business logic ... but that's probably going to be a lot of it. Before we bring on the revolution and cultivate a bunch of anarchy, it's important to understand why some things work ... to under path of path dependent development ... for example, we might want to begin by thinking about why the development of time keeping gadgets had such a big impact upon culture, the productivity of coordinated workflows and may have been the one big thing that made democracy [and large public gathering in public fora] even possible. In spite what might first appear to be chaotic, we should recognize the deeper order necessary to escape geographic constrainst and implicitly, voluntarily coordinate activities rather than demand appearance in meatspace -- thus, time managment discipline [and awareness of other schedules] is an even more important in ASYNCH.work and thus also part of this Reading List.
