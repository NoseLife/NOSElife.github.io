# Introduction

Computational linguistics is really about learn how to do machine-assisted or artificially-intelligent reading ... it's about building upon the semantic web and thinking in graphys. That's how it's done; why it's done is about using a machine to do something, ie make human lists machine readable and transforming into a graph, which is mildly tedious but really adds little, if any value compared to the cost of computing power. 

The computational reading listing is mostly about about papers with code or repositories of data/notebooks which provide forkable examples for us to learn about using machine learning, artificial intelligence, crowdsourcing, data APIs and other little skills in the structure of information, ontology and knowledge engineering to radically broaden, deepen and accelerate one's speed reading.

As you might guess, this is a particularly rapidly changing field. Everything that learned about reading and learning already is or soon will completely out-of-date ... still useful for insight, understanding -- but not current. 

Hopefully, you love learning new things ... you are going to need to learn how to learn on a JIT basis; it won't be a formal classroom sort of vacation from the daily grind -- it will be "learn while you grind" ... if you think that you know how to learn, you are going to have to break the bad habits of being yourself, unlearn what you thought you knew and then learn how to learn ... and you are going to have to do this for the rest of your life ... because, unless you missed it, we have completely turned a corner in how human communities learn/test/adapt now in crowds AND this human community learning is now also machine-augmented.  

It's not just that classroom environments are an antiquate time-wasting institution ... it's that the constructs for expressing ideas are changing more rapidly than ever ... the language of productive people in 2026 will be different from their language of 2021 ... you will recognize that this is not terribly new, ie whenever someone who talks like it's still the 1980s and has just had one's thinking shaped by HBR, MeetThePress or the NYTimes best selling books of 1981 *most of us* recognize that person is senile ... the same principle applies whether it's fifty years or five, but it might not be as recognizable.  

Staying current means understand different current vernaculars ... it's not just *Bullshit Bingo* -- it's necessary to grasp insights, ie to understand why Amazon was completely different and much tougher animal than AOL, Yahoo, eBay or a zillion other dotcoms [which didn't survive] in 1996 ... staying current is about ACTIVELY LISTENING to the important conversations and know which conversations are more important -- it's not about listenings to memories at a high school reunion, gathering of friends from college or attending some kind of funeral to celebrate the life of past glories. 

***ACTIVELY LISTENING now is about deploying technology to listen ... it is particularly important to learn the language of the computational linguistics field itself ... because of how it will impact your ability to listen in other fields.***  

2021 is definitely NOT 2016 in the realm of computational linguistics ... the pace of change in communication / information / knowledge has increased -- but when we add in AI, ML ops / text processing / pattern recognition AND also realize that it is all happening in a crowdly environment, we understand why the language of computational lingusitics is almost unrecognizable to someone still using 2011 concepts.  

Some words might still sound the same and thus trick people into thinking that the same terms/idioms still apply ... but the mathiness of the conversations surrounding implementatiion in different languages with different data APIs in computational lingustics is a clue that the field is moving faster. 

Obviously, some things don't really ever change, eg a dozen of eggs is still / probably always will be a very affordable way to obtain grams of protein -- although the dietary impact IS the same, the hysterical nature of the biased, untruthful nutrition reportage has not always been as well recognized  as it is now. 

So if you are in the nursing home, assist living center or some isolated area, you might be tempted to think that nothing has changed, eg "You always like your eggs for breakfast and you were not gonna change because of some hysterical nonsense!" -- except, that kind of thought in itself is proof of your isolation. There's nothing wrong with isolation ... as long as one actually knows what one is isolated from -- which is sorta impossible under complete isolation.

# What we can speak about, we must pass over in silence ... we shouldn't pass over it in ignorance.

It is really a matter of linguistics ... mapping ideas to words or pictures that have the same value to others.  

In the realm of machine-augmented humman learning ... we cannot get too far without talking about the concepts, frameworks, analytical models, philopophical constructs, data and data integrity, machine learning operations, data quality and observability, monitoring, measurement systems analysis, version control systems, distributed open source communities ... learning comes out of how we experience and communicate ideas AND then how we use our shared language for expressing those ideas to formulate new hypotheses and to design the experimental framework which will prove to us that our hypotheses have some validity.

People have always had a huge variety of different reasons for learning new languages but most of the time reason for NEEDING to do so is about "going somewhere" ... and NOW, maybe we want to *go* somewhere virtually, professionally or creatively, not necessarily in meatspace or to a geographic destination like the Grand Canyon or the ruins of ancient Greece ... in order for us to really GET SOMEWHERE in our virtual realm, we must be able to *think somewhat natively* in that NEW language. In my case, it is definitely NOT because I have something to SAY in that new territory ... it is because I want to LISTEN in someone else's native tongue.  

After all, if not for the part about *thinking somewhat natively* or to carry on a reasonably **meaningful** conversation, the utility of simple translators like Wikipedia to explain concepts or translate.google.com for words is a little too handy.  

Why should one bother with a new language if one just wants to babble out the same old crap ... does it matter which language one uses for a banal exchange? If your conversations are just a matter of "Have you tried the new oregano pasta at this restaurant?" OR "Which wine/dessert/cigar do you recommend?" OR some other example of consumption, THEN why bother? If you're not about production, but you just want to taste things -- then just swallow and express different levels of orgasmic pleasure or pain.

Of course, it is not just good, but probably essential, for a any senior citizen, ie someone over 30 or so (Dylan was spot-on correct about generally NEVER trusting people over 30 because most people stop thinking differently or learning new professions in their late twenties), to put one's old subconsious through the trauma and aggravation of learning to think differently in a different language, to reach that point where one finally really *gets it* and thinks conceptually using the constructs of the language. 

But we should understand that this attribute of different thinking in the *new language* could also pertain to something like a new profession OR new set of friends from a new job or hobby OR new set of computer languages and frameworks. 

The IMPORTANT part, for superior cognitive health/fitness and the level of health/fitness to even be able to exercise in the future, is the eustress of thinking radically differently that comes from thinking natively, in the idioms, jargon and common vernacular of an entirely different language.
