# Introduction / Background

Sun Microsystems had a slogan ... which applies now, more than it ever did when Sun Microsystems was in existence ... that THE NETWORK is the computer ... you could say that, instead of thinking in terms of a CENTRAL processing unit OR a Git HUB, most software dev professionals get it drastically wrong when they focus on bringing everything back to the center or to the hub ... quantum processing happens at the smart edge ... **THE NETWORK** is the *quantum computer* 

Our interest in the Quantum CloudKernel and a smart cloud, in which information/knowledge is DECENTRALIZED, is driven by our belief that the entire field of computer engineering has essential gotten it wrong ever since someone decided to focus on the CPU, the CENTRAL processing unit.

Our experience in jiujitsu shows us that the sensors/acuators are necessarily where the action is ... and quite possibly, it is the control of muscles, eg to breathe, pump/oxygenate blood, digest food and put nutrients in the bloodstream, is where much of our human ambition, drive, creativity and intelligence is ... the CENTRAL processing unit will never be starved for oxygen or bloodflow -- unless no attention is paid to what delivers the oxygen and bloodflow.
