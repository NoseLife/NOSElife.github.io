In order to have time to do important things ... you must refrain from doing STUPID things ... most of the ways to improve your life are going to be about what you REMOVE ... if you are looking for things to remove, the FIRST thing to remove is any defensiveness or excusemaking for why you engage in stupid shit. When you even suspect that something might be stupid, STOP defending it and see if you can prove to yourself why your stupid bad habit is essential ... if it's so essential, try making the habit pay for itself.

As a general rule, one of the first things to throw out is any use, especially more than one dose/day, of any drugs or alcohol. Please stop being a defensive crybaby about the bad habits that are killing you; if you want to get in the habit or removing stupid shit -- you will NEED to avoid your own mindfuckery ans stupid rationalizations.  A good example of this are the rationalizations for ANY use of drugs or alcohol.

Self-mindfuckery is necessarily a slippery slope, but MOST humans do more to fuck themselves over than everyone else combined ... aliens, for example, are not stupid enough to give a living fuck about your pathetic existence -- there are spiders more interesting to pay attention. NOBODY CARES ... so stop blaming anything on anyone other than the person in the mirror.

Drugs and alcohol are the kinds of thing that humans always get wrong ... because, first of all, in order for the stuff to work, the shit has to fuck with your own mind and it gives you that crutch. It's the crutch that you can't afford to keep using, not just the drug. To illustrate, perhaps a cup of coffee in the morning is okay; perhaps a drink with dinner are not going to cost you much in sharpness ... yeah ... believe what you want, but YOU are WEAK, if only because YOU need a CRUTCH to get by ... it's YOU and YOUR dependency on the crutch, instead of you and your creative way to build independence. 

If you use drugs/alchol in any serious amount, not just in excess, but as a crutch to deal with stress or bad sleep hygiene, you will greatly reduce the time that you have to THINK or to do the important things that you should do with your life. In order to have time to do important things ... you must not only refrain from doing STUPID things ... but, more importantly, you must refrain from getting defensive and making excuses for doing stupid things.

## Stop swallowing mindlessly

The point of your life should not be about swallowing your way to strength or to some comfortable bliss ... but, if your consumption defines you, your time will *harvested* as a wage-slave in order to pay for your swallowing ... at best, you will be able to retire comfortably to be defined as a tourist and one who enjoys consumption and swallowing. You don't have to be defined by your swallowing, but you can use your life for that.

**Especially Stop swallowing things that destroy your mind** ... you definitely should never swallow anything from a news organization ... if you need to swallow something every day, you should realize that you have a problem and are powerless over your addiction ... until you stop swallowing ... but ALL news organizations ONLY produce things that drive hatred and divison.

There are ONLY 86,400 seconds/day ... you're probably not going to live past 125 or so, although you may very well live much longer than you want to live ... you have a very finite stock of time to use optimally each day ... you simply do not have ANY time to take in anything coming from a news organization, because EVERY SINGLE NEW ITEM is going to be some sort of hate-spawning us-vs-them propaganda ... and, if that were not bad enough, the material will come from the last-to-know, furtherest-behind-the-curve, PR regurgitator journous and their editors ... news organizations are incapable of finding stories about good developments.

## In general avoid video; instead develop your efficiency as a speed reader
Video is the SLOWEST POSSIBLE WAY to learn most things ... a video might be okay when you're looking for ways do a unique home repair on the kind of thing where you are a complete noobie amateur AND there are no great schematics created to professionally illustrate the concepts, but otherwise, video presentation is for the lowest common denominator audience. 

After you have developed any decent proficiency in reading or data analysis, it is painful to  watch something as ineffiecient as delivering ideas as with video ... ALMOST nobody, who reads regularly reads as slowly as someone speaks or presents an idea on video ... it is tough to stay focuced on a video webinar because it takes 8-10 hours well-scripted, annoated, time-stamped video to present what someone can read in 30 minutes of well-written content [intended for peer reveiw] or available in a jupyter notebook with code/data. 

It is important to understand the basic math of why video sucks as bad as video does. We all know that rapid-talking people speak at a rate of 150 - 200 words per minute ... preachers and politicians are significantly, sometimes painfully slower [for emphasis]... as Lincoln's Gettysburg Address shows us, anyone who's REALLY sharp at conveying the central message of a major historic even can do so in about two or three minutes OR otherwise, they're just spewing nonsense in order to come back later practice editing.  

If we look at the basic math of the [Gettysburg address](https://shiny.stt.msu.edu/fairbour/Gettysburg/) ... 268 words ... that's two minute speech because, the event is solemn enough by itself so the speech should be mostly short words ... today there'd be less need to flower-up the opening language -- today, Lincold would say "Just 87 years ago" RATHER than "Four score and seven years ago"... and THAT is the point ... there are few speeches that are more memorable than the Gettysburg address, because WHY? ... isn't it obvious?!

 **SHORT is defining characteristic of MEMORABLE** ... which means that ... a video longer than 3 minutes is necessarily never going to have a chance of being something worth remembering.***

Video is horrendously slow at delivering concepts; even though imporant clips can be replayed/dissected and then copied and practiced ... but it is your PRACTICE with the ideas, concepts, data ... it's YOU doing the math and proving to your satisfaction, so that you can demonstrate the proof for others which instructs you ... it is YOUR practice that you learn from, learning does not come from being *practiced at*.  

When we look at transcripts of five hour instructional videos, we see that most can be read/scanned for useful content in 10-20 minutes, ie less than 1/10 of the time ... if you need your information delivered to at video speed, you need to READ and develop your ability to think about stucture of content.

## Stay in touch, but avoid getting sucked into much time on social media.

You can stay up to date by rapidly scrolling through your emails, rapidly scrollng through your feed of announcements by friends/family and by curating the feeds, eg rapidly scrolling ... with UNFOLLOWING, UNSUBSCRIBING and IGNORING 99% of the content, eg the shit emails that you're CC'd on, but don't pertain to you.  

You HAVE TO develop the skill of rapid scrolling. It's ok, maybe even necessary, to take-the-pulse of friends/family or to see-where-their-heads-are-at on social media ... NEVER EVER EVER waste time trying to be liked ... your comments should be brutally honest and helpful to people -- so honest that they will never ever consider inviting you to dinner, because you are too honest, too much of a mirror.

# News organizations are ONLY hate-inducing propaganda

The only valid, sustainable response anything coming from a news organization is to IGNORE the shitstorm ... not just the NY Times or Drudge or Brietbart or Townhall ...  but ignore every last ORGANIZED purveyor of schlock ... avoid the entire climate and atmosphere producing all shitstorms and responses to shitstorms ... from ALL news organizations and ALL political journos ... **you ain't gonna need any of it.**

*If you are still operating in that field ... re-trace your steps somehow and exit the landmine NOW ... stop participating and lending ANY credence whatsover to the profession.*

If it were not clear enough before, we are in the middle of an information nuclear war or thermonuclear meltdown ... ALL news reporting by ALL news organizations is fully weaponized and devoid of any legitimate content, execpt in the meta-sense, eg serving as an indication of the depravity of the journo or news organization dishing up the radioactive poison.  

If you are still operating in that field ... re-trace your steps somehow and exit the landmine NOW ... stop participating and lending ANY credence whatsover to the profession.

## ICYMI ... the "reporting" by ANYONE on January 6th was a crystal clear indication that news organizations are obviously NOT reporting any more

If it were not obvious enough before, the BLATANT propagandization of the main stream media continues to break into brand new areas of complete disgustingness ... if there was any doubt that new depths could be plumbed, consider the reportage on January 6th ... the best response is to just turn ALL of it off and leave it off. 

***The neon signs on the way out of Sodom and Gomorrah always flash "Do NOT look back." ... but the souls who need to DIE will need to look back.***

There's one example on that one exemplary day which might best illustrate the point ... on January 6th, the New York Times claimed, BASED ON UNNAMED SOURCES, that UNKNOWN parties MIGHT HAVE embedded malware in JetBrains software which might have made the [SolarWinds hack](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2020_United_States_federal_government_data_breach) and other widespread security compromises more possible.

One has to wonder HOW is this even news to NY Times readers? Are NY Times readers that clueless about development IDEs and the introduction of security issues into code -- that lack of infosec literacy itself would be concerning. If there's any merit [for the clueless] to the story whatsoever, something like this not news to information security professionals ... HINT: Except for idiots [who shouold not be employed and earning salaries], nobody *really* trusts their dev toolchain or devices. Moreover, professionals build checks into their processes and then, several others, do othogonal independent checks on the checks that people have put in place. Why was it necessary for the NYTimes editors to dish up this hysterical radioactive waste with other unfounded assertions on January 6th? Of course, we all KNOW what the answer is ... as a result...

*Anything produced by a news organization is at the top of our* ***Do NOT Waste Your Time Reading This SHIT*** *list.*
