# The Importance of Curating Annotated Reading Lists

Annotated Reading Lists can and should also be represented as semantic graphs because the lists are really a matter of semantic connections. Many information science professionals, software developers, information systems architects and librarians will tend to already inherently graphs the fundamentals of graph theory, how it is used to represent and explore data, and how it relates to the semantic web. 

Our choice of using a very simple construct like an annotated reading lists is really about emphasizing the ease of onboarding for user-contributors to open source solutions.  Something as simple as list is a basic tools that solves very practical organization problem at a conceptual level, with zero emphasis on algorithms or mathematics ... we can automate taking the list just beyond this with a graph with very little algorithmic heavy lifting.

The point of turning the corner to go from lists to thinking in graphs and graphQL data APIs is that many of the graph theory concepts can drive the knowledge connections between various scientific disciplines and subdisciplines. In other words, the reading list allows humans to establish the conceptual paths and trails through topics as they learn ... but the reader just browses and grazes, without worrying about database schemas or doing all kinds of ontological tasks wrong ... as the revisions accumulate and connections are annotated/commented upon, these "worn" trails pave the way for ontological networks, graph tools, graph analysis libraries, solutions to information libraries and knowledge network problems, semantic graphs and the semantic web.

The EXERCISE of continually curating annotated reading lists is really about the routine discipline of little tasks, eg daily reading, that advance the personal discipline as well as mental/social fitness necessary to [participate in build LIVING open source knowledge development communities](http://markbruns.github.io/science/2021/01/01/the-exercise-of-curated-annotated-reading-lists.html) ... without the regular exercise of different knowledge development *muscles* atrophy occurs, especially in areas of knowledge where communities evolve and grow or die, the language and terminology changes, where different minds become more or less engaged.
